Dr. Achraf Atila studied physics at the University of Hassan II in Casablanca, from which he obtained his Bachelor of Science in physics and applications in 2015 and Master of Science in physics and new technologies in 2017. After finishing his M.Sc, he moved to Germany and started a Ph.D. in the group of Prof. Dr.-ing. Erik Bitzek at the Institute I: General Materials Properties, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, FAU in Erlangen. Starting from July 2022 he joined the group of Prof. Dr. Martin MÃ¼ser as a postdoctoral research associate working on atomistic simulations of different organic and inorganic materials. From July 2021 till December 2022, Achraf held a guest scientist position at Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Eisenforschung GmbH in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.

Achraf is a computational material scientist, focusing on amorphous materials, with a strong interest in the relationship between composition, structure, and other physical properties. His research mostly focuses on the mechanical behavior and deformation mechanisms in glasses.
